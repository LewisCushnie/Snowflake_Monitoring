-- Description:
-- Identifies which users are consuming the most credits within your Snowflake environment.

-- How to Interpret Results:
-- Are there certain users that are consuming more credits than they should? What is the purpose behind this additional usage?

-- Primary Schema:
-- Account_Usage

--THIS IS APPROXIMATE CREDIT CONSUMPTION BY USER
