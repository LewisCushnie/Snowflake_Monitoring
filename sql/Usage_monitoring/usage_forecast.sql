-- Description:
-- This query provides three distinct consumption metrics for each day of the contract term. (1) the contracted consumption is the dollar amount consumed if usage was flat for the entire term. (2) the actual consumption pulls from the various usage views and aggregates dollars at a day level. (3) the forecasted consumption creates a straight line regression from the actuals to project go-forward consumption.

-- How to Interpret Results:
-- This data should be mapped as line graphs with a running total calculation to estimate future forecast against the contract amount.

-- Primary Schema:
-- Account_Usage
