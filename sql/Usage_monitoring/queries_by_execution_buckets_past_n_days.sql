-- Description:
-- Group the queries for a given warehouse by execution time buckets

-- How to Interpret Results:
-- This is an opportunity to identify query SLA trends and make a decision to downsize a warehouse, upsize a warehouse, or separate out some queries to another warehouse

-- Primary Schema:
-- Account_Usage
