-- Description:
-- Shows the total credit consumption for each warehouse over a specific time period.

-- How to Interpret Results:
-- Are there specific warehouses that are consuming more credits than the others? Should they be? Are there specific warehouses that are consuming more credits than anticipated for that warehouse?

-- Primary Schema:
-- Account_Usage

// Credits used (all time = past year)
SELECT WAREHOUSE_NAME
      ,SUM(CREDITS_USED_COMPUTE) AS CREDITS_USED_COMPUTE_SUM
  FROM ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY
 GROUP BY 1
 ORDER BY 2 DESC
;

// Credits used (past N days/weeks/months)
SELECT WAREHOUSE_NAME
      ,SUM(CREDITS_USED_COMPUTE) AS CREDITS_USED_COMPUTE_SUM
  FROM ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY
 WHERE START_TIME >= DATEADD(DAY, -7, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())  // Past 7 days
 GROUP BY 1
 ORDER BY 2 DESC
