-- Description:
-- This query is designed to give a rough idea of how busy Warehouses are compared to the credit consumption per hour. It will show the end user the number of credits consumed, the number of queries executed and the total execution time of those queries in each hour window.

-- How to Interpret Results:
-- This data can be used to draw correlations between credit consumption and the #/duration of query executions. The more queries or higher query duration for the fewest number of credits may help drive more value per credit.

-- Primary Schema:
-- Account_Usage
