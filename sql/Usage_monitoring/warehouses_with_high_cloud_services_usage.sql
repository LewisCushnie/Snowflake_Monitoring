-- Description:
-- Shows the warehouses that are not using enough compute to cover the cloud services portion of compute, 
-- ordered by the ratio of cloud services to total compute

-- How to Interpret Results:
-- Focus on Warehouses that are using a high volume and ratio of cloud services compute. Investigate why this 
-- is the case to reduce overall cost (might be cloning, listing files in S3, partner tools setting session 
-- parameters, etc.). The goal to reduce cloud services credit consumption is to aim for cloud services credit to 
-- be less than 10% of overall credits. ####Primary Schema: Account_Usage
