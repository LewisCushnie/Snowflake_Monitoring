-- Description:
-- This query orders the most expensive queries from the last 30 days. It takes into account the warehouse size, assuming that a 1 minute query on larger warehouse is more expensive than a 1 minute query on a smaller warehouse

-- How to Interpret Results:
-- This is an opportunity to evaluate expensive queries and take some action. The admin could:

-- -look at the query profile

-- -contact the user who executed the query

-- -take action to optimize these queries

-- Primary Schema:
-- Account_Usage
