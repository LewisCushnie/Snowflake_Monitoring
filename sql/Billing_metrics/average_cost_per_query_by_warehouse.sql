-- Description:
-- This summarize the query activity and credit consumption per warehouse over the last month. The query also includes the ratio of queries executed to credits consumed on the warehouse

-- How to Interpret Results:
-- Highlights any scenarios where warehouse consumption is significantly out of line with the number of queries executed. Maybe auto-suspend needs to be adjusted or warehouses need to be consolidated.

-- Primary Schema:
-- Account_Usage
