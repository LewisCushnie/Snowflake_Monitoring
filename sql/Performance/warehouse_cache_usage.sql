-- Description:
-- Aggregate across all queries broken out by warehouses showing the percentage of data scanned from the warehouse cache.

-- How to Interpret Results:
-- Look for warehouses that are used from querying/reporting and have a low percentage. This indicates that the warehouse is suspending too quickly

-- Primary Schema:
-- Account_Usage
