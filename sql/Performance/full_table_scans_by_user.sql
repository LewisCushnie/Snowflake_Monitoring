-- Description:
-- These queries are the list of users that run the most queries with near full table scans and then the list of the queries themselves.

-- This is a potential opportunity to train the user or enable clustering.

-- Primary Schema:
-- Account_Usage

--who are the users with the most (near) full table scans
