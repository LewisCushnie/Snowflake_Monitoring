-- Description:
-- This query returns an aggregated daily summary of all loads for each table in Snowflake showing average file size, total rows, total volume and the ingest method (copy or snowpipe)

-- How to Interpret Results:
-- With this high-level information you can determine if file sizes are too small or too big for optimal ingest. If you can map the volume to credit consumption you can determine which tables are consuming more credits per TB loaded.

-- Primary Schema:
-- Account_Usage
