-- Description:
-- Lists out all warehouses that are used by multiple ROLEs in Snowflake and returns the average execution time and count of all queries executed by each ROLE in each warehouse.

-- How to Interpret Results:
-- If execution times or query counts across roles within a single warehouse are wildly different it might be worth segmenting those users into separate warehouses and configuring each warehouse to meet the specific needs of each workload

-- Primary Schema:
-- Account_Usage
