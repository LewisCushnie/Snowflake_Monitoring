-- Description:
-- Identifies all warehouses that do not have auto-resume enabled. Enabling this feature will automatically resume a warehouse any time a query is submitted against that specific warehouse. By default, all warehouses have auto-resume enabled.

-- How to Interpret Results:
-- Make sure all warehouses are set to auto resume. If you are going to implement auto suspend and proper timeout limits, this is a must or users will not be able to query the system.
