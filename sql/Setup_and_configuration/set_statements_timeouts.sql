-- Description:
-- Statement timeouts provide additional controls around how long a query is able to run before cancelling it. Using this feature will ensure that any queries that get hung up for extended periods of time will not cause excessive consumption of credits.

-- Show parameter settings at the Account, Warehouse, and User Session levels.

-- How to Interpret Results:
-- This parameter is set at the account level by default. When the parameter is also set for both a warehouse and a user session, the lowest non-zero value is enforced.
