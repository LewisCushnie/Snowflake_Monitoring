-- Description:
-- Identifies warehouses that have the longest setting for automatic suspension after a period of no activity on that warehouse.

-- How to Interpret Results:
-- All warehouses should have an appropriate setting for automatic suspension for the workload.

-- – For Tasks, Loading and ETL/ELT warehouses set to immediate suspension.

-- – For BI and SELECT query warehouses set to 10 minutes for suspension to keep data caches warm for end users

-- – For DevOps, DataOps and Data Science warehouses set to 5 minutes for suspension as warm cache is not as important to ad-hoc and highly unique queries.
