-- Description:
-- Identifies all warehouses that do not have auto-suspend enabled. Enabling this feature will ensure that warehouses become suspended after a specific amount of inactive time in order to prevent runaway costs. By default, all warehouses have auto-suspend enabled.

-- How to Interpret Results:
-- Make sure all warehouses are set to auto suspend. This way when they are not processing queries your compute footprint will shrink and thus your credit burn.
