-- Description:
-- Identifies all warehouses without resource monitors in place. Resource monitors provide the ability to set limits on credits consumed against a warehouse during a specific time interval or date range. This can help prevent certain warehouses from unintentionally consuming more credits than typically expected.

-- How to Interpret Results:
-- Warehouses without resource monitors in place could be prone to excessive costs if a warehouse consumes more credits than anticipated. Leverage the results of this query to identify the warehouses that should have resource monitors in place to prevent future runaway costs.
