-- Description:
-- Indicates whether the offset for the stream is positioned at a point earlier than the data retention period for the table (or 14 days, whichever period is longer). Change data capture (CDC) activity cannot be returned for the table.

-- How to Interpret Results:
-- To return CDC activity for the table, recreate the stream. To prevent a stream from becoming stale, consume the stream records within a transaction during the retention period for the table.
